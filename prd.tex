\begin{abstract} \noindent
Oscillons are spatially stationary, quasi-periodic solutions of nonlinear field theories seen in settings ranging from granular systems, low temperature condensates and  early universe cosmology. We describe a new class of oscillon in which the spatial envelope can have ``off centre'' maxima and pulsate on timescales much longer than the fundamental frequency. These  are exact solutions of the 1-D sine-Gordon equation and we demonstrate numerically that similar solutions exist in up to three dimensions for a range of potentials. The dynamics of these solutions match key properties of  oscillons that may form after cosmological inflation in string-motivated monodromy scenarios.

\noindent
Oscillons are localized, oscillatory solutions to non-linear wave equations with  lifetimes far longer than the  fundamental frequency of the underlying system. Oscillon-like solutions have been observed in many systems, including Bose-Einstein condensates \cite{PhysRevA.91.023631}, nonlinear optics \cite{PhysRevLett.108.093901}, vibrated granular materials \cite{Copeland:1995fq,Tsimring:1997zz}, while the  early universe may contain a phase during which most mass-energy is localized in oscillons   \cite{Copeland:1995fq,Hindmarsh:2006ur,Hindmarsh:2007jb,Amin:2010dc,Amin:2010xe,Gleiser:2011xj,Amin:2011hj,Zhou:2013tsa,Amin:2013ika}. Beyond their importance to a broad range of experimental and theoretical domains, oscillons are fascinating  nonlinear systems as their longevity is a product of their  dynamics \cite{Copeland:1995fq,PhysRevD.80.125037} rather than  symmetries of the underlying systems.     

%Previous studies have identified Gaussian \cite{Copeland:1995fq,PhysRevD.80.125037,Gleiser:2008ty} and flat-top \cite{Amin:2010jq} oscillons, and the sine-Gordon breather  \cite{:/content/aip/journal/jmp/25/7/10.1063/1.526415}. 

This Letter describes a new category of oscillons, whose  rich phenomenology is characterized by long term pulsations superimposed on the fundamental oscillatory dynamics and spatial profiles with  ``off-centre'' peaks. These solutions share  hitherto unexplored properties of oscillons seen in simulations of the primordial universe following axion monodromy inflation \cite{stringInflationBook,Silverstein:2008sg,McAllister:2008hb,Flauger:2009ab,Amin:2010dc, Amin:2011hj}. We  construct these models as exact solutions to the sine-Gordon equation in one dimension and   numerically explore similar solutions in the sine-Gordon, $\phi^6$ and axion-monodromy potentials in up to three spatial dimensions. 
 
 \medbreak\noindent {\em Exact Solutions:} Consider the Klein-Gordon equation
 %
 \begin{equation}\label{kg}
 \Box u(t,\bar{x}) + \frac{ d V(u)}{du} = 0
 \end{equation}
 %
where  $\Box$ is the d'Alembertian.  With the sine-Gordon potential $V(u) = 1-\cos(u)$,  this system is integrable in $1+1$D Minkowski space and has  many exact solutions,  including the well-known ``breather'' 
 %

%
\begin{equation}\label{single}
  u(t,x) = 4 \arctan\left[ \frac{\sqrt{1-\omega^2} \cos \omega t}{\omega \cosh \sqrt{1-\omega^2} x} \right] \, .
\end{equation}
%
When the characteristic frequency $\omega\to1$, the argument of the $\arctan$ is small, and eq.~(\ref{single}) reduces to a Gaussian  
%
\begin{equation}
  u(t,x) \approx \frac{4\sqrt{1-\omega^2}\cos\omega t}{\cosh \sqrt{1-\omega^2} x} \approx A\exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{R^2}\right)\cos\omega t \,
\end{equation}
%
where the amplitude $A = 4\sqrt{1-\omega^2}$ and the width at half maximum $R=(\arccosh 2) /\sqrt{(\log 2)(1 - \omega^2)}$. One may use the Gaussian oscillon as a template, finding stability and existence conditions as a function of $A$ and $R$  \cite{Gleiser:2008ty}. Separately, ``flat-top" solutions are found with a sixth-order potential \cite{Amin:2010jq}, along with rotationally symmetric generalizations beyond one dimension. 

Motivated by the complex dynamics seen in the oscillon dominated phase \cite{Amin:2011hj} following monodromy inflation \cite{Silverstein:2008sg,McAllister:2008hb,Flauger:2009ab} and similar solutions noted in Refs.~\cite{Hindmarsh:2006ur,Amin:2010xe,Salmi:2012ta} we  construct an exact  ``double-breather'' in the 1D sine-Gordon model, 
%
 \begin{eqnarray}\label{twoscale1}
  u(t,x)&=&4 \arctan \frac{(\omega_1^2-\omega_2^2)(\ch_1\,\cs_2+\ch_2\,\cs_1)}{\td(t)+\sp(x)} \, , \\
    \td(t) &=& (\omega_1^2+\omega_2^2)\,\cs_1\cs_2 +2 \sin \omega_1 t \sin \omega_2 t \, , \\
  \sp(x) &=& (\mu_1^2+\mu_2^2)\,\ch_1\ch_2 - 2  \sinh \mu_1 x \sinh \mu_2 x  \, .
\end{eqnarray}
%
\begin{equation}\label{twoscale2}
    \cs_i = \frac{\cos \omega_i t}{\omega_i} \quad \ch_i = \frac{\cosh \mu_i x}{\mu_i}  \quad   \mu_i=\sqrt{1-\omega_i^2} \, .
\end{equation}    
 %
This ``non-linear superposition'' of two simple breathers can be constructed via the B\"acklund transformation  \cite{Dodd499, hietarinta1997introduction, Cuenda20111047} or the  inverse scattering transform \cite{ablowitz, :/content/aip/journal/jmp/51/12/10.1063/1.3520596}, and may be verified by direct calculation. The solution is antisymmetric with respect to  $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ and $0<\omega_i<1$; when either $\omega_i \rightarrow 1$ we recover the single-frequency breather.

\end{figure} 


\medbreak\noindent {\em Qualitative Description:}    Fig.~\ref{profiles} shows two typical field profiles; further examples and animations are included in the Supplementary Material. Two key features of these solutions are long-period pulsations superimposed on the oscillon dynamics and spatial profiles with peaks displaced from the origin.    

We quantify the peak-displacement via
%
\begin{equation}
  \langle r_{\rm max} \rangle  = \left\langle \argmax_{x < r_0} |u(t,x)| \right\rangle_t
\end{equation}
%
the time-average of the peak field value. Spurious maxima associated with outgoing radiation can appear when $u$ is close to zero for moderate $r$; these are excluded via the cutoff  $r_0$. We quantify the strength of pulsations of the envelope via $S$, the product of the period and amplitude of the dominant periodic mode in the time series of maxima at the origin, $|u(t,0)|$.  Plots of $S$ and $r_{\rm max}$ for the exact ``double breather'' are shown in Fig.~\ref{sine-1d}. If one of the $\omega_i$ is close to unity $r_{\rm max}$ is zero.

  \caption{Values $\langle r_{\rm max}\rangle$ (upper) and  $\log{S}$ (lower) for 1D sine-Gordon.}\label{sine-1d}
\end{figure}

%In the limit  $\delta=\omega_1-\omega_2$ is small the peak displacement at $t=0$ can be shown to be
%\begin{equation}\label{disp}
%  x_d = \frac{1}{2\mu}\cosh^{-1}\left(\frac{2\mu^4}{3\omega^4}\left(1-\frac{2\omega}{\delta}+\frac{4\omega^2}{\delta^2}\right)-1\right)
%\end{equation}
%where $\omega=\omega_1$ and $\mu=\sqrt{1-\omega^2}$.   The  double peak grows more prominent if $\omega_1 \rightarrow  \omega_2$, accounting for the large values of  $r_{\rm max}$  near the diagonal in Fig.~\ref{sine-1d}; conversely if $x_d$ is imaginary  $\langle r_{\rm max}\rangle=0$.

      Left to right: 1D, 2D, 3D. We see that 50\% of the initial energy typically remains in the oscillon, and the peak is displaced furthest from the origin when $\omega_1 \approx \omega_2$. All choices of  $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ lead to a pulsating envelope, which is most pronounced when $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are small in 2D and 3D. The ``holes'' in the 1D solution are associated with cases where the initial profile splits into two single oscillons moving away from the origin.}\label{axion-monodromy}
\end{figure*}


\medbreak\noindent{\em General Potentials and Dimensionality:}   We  assess the existence of qualitatively similar solutions to eqs.~\ref{twoscale1}--\ref{twoscale2}  for the axion monodromy  and sixth-order potentials in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, and the sine-Gordon in 2 and 3 dimensions. The relevant potentials are:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
  V(u) &=& \sqrt{1+u^2}-1 \label{axion-potential} \, ,\\
  V(u) &=& \frac{u^2}{2} - \frac{u^4}{4!} +g \frac{ u^6}{6!} \, .
\end{eqnarray}
%
Note that possible constant factors are set to unity by coordinate transformations and/or rescaling $u$ \cite{Amin:2010dc,Amin:2011hj}.

We solve the Klein-Gordon equation numerically with an added ``viscosity''  at large $r$ to absorb outgoing radiation. We assume a radially symmetric field configuration with the exact 1D sine-Gordon solution as the initial profile, in contrast to  a Gaussian ansatz of e.g. Refs.~\cite{Hindmarsh:2006ur,Gleiser:2008ty,Gleiser:2009ys,Salmi:2012ta}.  For the numerical solutions we quantify the overlap with the exact double-breather profile via the fraction of the initial  energy contained within a fixed radius at late times, recalling that the energy density is:
%
\begin{equation}
  e(t,\bar{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\left(u_t^2+ \nabla u\cdot\nabla u \right) + V(u) \, .
\end{equation}
%
Fig.~\ref{axion-monodromy} shows our qualitative measures for the axion monodromy potential (eq.~\ref{axion-potential}) in 1, 2, and 3D. In almost all cases we see an oscillon with $>50\%$ of the initial energy; $\langle r_{\rm max}\rangle$ has a similar dependence on $(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ to the 1D sine-Gordon case and we see significant pulsations across the $(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ plane.

For the sine-Gordon potential, we find long-lived, pulsating oscillons in 2D (in agreement with  \cite{Hindmarsh:2006ur}) but $E/E_{\rm init}$ is much less than unity, suggesting these oscillons are  less closely related to their exact 1D analogues. In 3D, our initial ansatz does not yield stable oscillons over most of the $(\omega_1,\omega_2)$ plane. The sixth-order potential  supports pulsating oscillons  in 1, 2 and 3D when $g$ is small; for large $g$ they only exist if  $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are close to unity.

\medbreak\noindent{\em  Axion-monodromy Inflation:} In  axion-monodromy inflation  \cite{Silverstein:2008sg,McAllister:2008hb,Flauger:2009ab} parametric resonance can be followed by an oscillon-dominated phase  \cite{Amin:2011hj,Zhou:2013tsa}. A  representative configuration  extracted from a simulation of the expanding, post-inflationary universe \cite{Easther:2010qz} is shown in Fig.~\ref{oscillons}. These monodromy oscillons can exhibit strong pulsations with  complex dynamics, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{raw}.  One might wonder if some of the longest-period modulations are induced by the oscillon's interaction with its environment,  finite resolution effects in a 3D code, or the overall expansion of the universe, a necessary  ingredient for the resonant production of oscillons in the cosmological simulations. However, similar oscillon solutions are seen in the spherically symmetric code initialised with a 1D sine-Gordon profile with one of the $\omega_i\to1$. Ref.~\cite{Salmi:2012ta} previously investigated 3D oscillons in a monodromy-like potential initialised with a Gaussian profile. For these solutions the Fourier spectrum of $u(t,0)$ has several distinct peaks, but the dominant mode has $\sim 100\times$ more power than the next highest peaks. The corresponding spectrum seen here is far more complex,  as can be seen from  Fig.~\ref{fourier}. The overall energy of these oscillons can decrease abruptly, suggesting that on long timescales the solutions are aperiodic. The oscillons seen in the full 3D simulations (Fig.~\ref{oscillons}) do not have off-center peaks.  

In the limit where  both $\omega$ terms are  close to unity, using trigonometric identities to combine the $\cosh$ and $\cos$ terms the solution in eqs.~\ref{twoscale1}--\ref{twoscale2} reduces to
%
\begin{equation} \label{fitprof}
  u(t,r) = A\cos\omega t \frac{\sqrt{1+\epsilon \cos \delta t}}{\cosh(r/R) + \epsilon \cos \delta t}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon<1$ and $\delta = \omega_1-\omega_2 \ll 1$. This provides an analytical template for further exploration of these solutions and yields a tolerable fit for many (although not all) of the oscillons found in the 3D solutions on moderate timescales, as seen in Fig.~\ref{simul-prof}. 

\medbreak\noindent{\em Conclusion:} We have explored  pulsating oscillons starting from exact solutions to the 1D sine-Gordon equation. They are characterised by a long-term pulsation of their envelope and spatial profiles with peaks displaced from the origin. We find qualitatively similar solutions in the  2D sine-Gordon model, and the $\phi^6$ and axion-monodromy potentials in 1, 2, and 3D. These solutions illuminate the complex properties of  oscillons that can form in the very early universe \cite{Amin:2011hj}, point to rich new possibilities for  laboratory  studies of nonlinear phenomena, and reveal a rich new class of solutions to the nonlinear wave equation.
